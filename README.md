# To-Do List App (Node.js & Express)

## ✨ Features

* **Full-Stack:** Complete separation of back-end logic and front-end UI.
* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, and Delete tasks.
* **Dynamic UI:** The page updates instantly using the `fetch` API—no page reloads needed.
* **Dark/Light Theme:** A theme toggle that remembers your choice using `localStorage`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js, Cors
* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+ `async/await`)
